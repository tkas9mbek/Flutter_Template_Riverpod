# flutter_template

A custom template for Flutter apps.

## Getting Started

The template contains the minimal implementation required to create a new project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants, localization and required dependencies to create a new project. This will help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

### Packages
* **hooks_riverpod** (State Management)
* **easy_localization** (Localization)
* **go_router** (Routing)
* custom client using **dio**
* easily customisable lints
* packages useful in most projects: **shared_preferences**, **permission_handler**, 
  **introduction_screen**, **form_builder**, **google_fonts**
